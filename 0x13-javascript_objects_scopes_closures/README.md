File|Task
---|---
0. Rectangle | Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
1. Rectangle | The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h. Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w. Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
2. Rectangle | If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
3. Rectangle | Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
4. Rectangle | Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X. Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle. Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2
5. Square | Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js
6. Square | Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
7. Occurrences|Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)
8. Esrever | Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list
9. Log me | Prototype: exports.logMe = function (item) Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>
10. Number conversion|Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument:Prototype: exports.converter = function (base).You are not allowed to import any file.You are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc..)
